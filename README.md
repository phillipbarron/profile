# profile

Profile setup script - installs zsh & on-my-zsh then adds some other stuff.

```bash
./setuo-profile.sh
```

### todo

* create a variables file for all the secret stuff and reference throughout
* integrate with [profile stuff](https://github.com/phillipbarron/dev-env)
* make sure this works both on the mac and linux (in progress)
